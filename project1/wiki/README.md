## Overview

Wiki is a lightweight online encyclopedia that allows users to create, edit, search, and browse encyclopedia entries. Entries are stored in Markdown for easy editing and converted to HTML for viewing. The project is built using the Django framework.

## Features

1. **Entry Page**  
   - Visiting `/wiki/TITLE` displays the content of an encyclopedia entry with the title `TITLE`.
   - If the entry does not exist, the user sees an error page.

2. **Index Page**  
   - Displays a list of all available encyclopedia entries.
   - Each entry name is clickable and redirects to its corresponding page.

3. **Search**  
   - Users can search for entries using a search bar.
   - If the search query matches an entry, the user is redirected to that entry's page.
   - If the query is a substring of any entry, a list of matching entries is displayed.

4. **Create New Page**  
   - Users can create new encyclopedia entries by providing a title and Markdown content.
   - If an entry with the same title exists, the user is shown an error message.

5. **Edit Page**  
   - Users can edit existing entries using a pre-populated form with the current Markdown content.
   - Edited content is saved, and the user is redirected to the updated entry.

6. **Random Page**  
   - A "Random Page" link allows users to visit a random entry.

7. **Markdown to HTML Conversion**  
   - Markdown content is converted to HTML for rendering on entry pages.
   - The `markdown2` library is used for this purpose (install with `pip3 install markdown2`).
